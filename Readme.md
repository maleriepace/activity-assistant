Activities of Daily living (ADLs) e.g cooking, working, sleeping and device readings are recorded by smart home inhabitants. The goal is to predict inhabitants activities using device readings. Activity-assistant is a platform that streamlines the process of data collection. It can track selected devices and persons. Using the android app, device readings can be labeled with current activities. Furthermore activity-assistant supports the deployment of trained models running predictions in real-time. A homeassistant integration offers users a way to automate stuff based on activity predictions.

## Installation

The installation of this add-on is pretty straightforward and not different in comparison to installing any other Hass.io add-on.

1. add the repository to the addon-store by pasting `http://github.com/tcsvn/hassio-activity-assistant` into the manage add-on repositories dialog  
2. Ensure that homeassistant uses sqlite as database and that it is available in the configuration folder (for standard installations this is the case)
3. Search for the "activity-assistant" addon-on in the Hass.io add-on store and install it.
4. Start the "activity-assistant" add-on.
5. Check the logs of the add-on to see if everything went well.
6. Ready to go!
